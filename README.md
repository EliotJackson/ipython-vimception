IPython Vimception
==================

Vim-within-vim in the IPython Notebook.

This is a work in progress. For now, put these files into the `extensions`
subdirectory of whatever `ipython locate` returns, usually these files go into
the `~/.ipython/extensions` directory.

Once you do that, in the notebook, just make a cell that will do 

    %load_ext vimception


It's all very rough right now, I'm working on it, so hang tight.
